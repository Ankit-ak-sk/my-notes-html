    <p align="center">Perfume, also known as fragrance, is a mixture of aromatic compounds, essential oils, and solvents used to produce a pleasant scent. The art of creating perfumes, known as perfumery, has a rich history that dates back thousands of years. Here are some key aspects of perfume:
       <b><i> Types of Perfume</i></b><br>
Perfumes are classified based on their concentration of aromatic compounds, which affects their intensity and longevity:

Parfum (Extrait de Parfum): Contains the highest concentration of fragrance oils, typically between 20-30%. It's the most long-lasting and intense type of perfume.
Eau de Parfum (EDP): Has a concentration of about 15-20% fragrance oils. It's less concentrated than parfum but still has good longevity and projection.
Eau de Toilette (EDT): Contains about 5-15% fragrance oils. It's lighter and often used as a daytime fragrance.
Eau de Cologne (EDC): Has a concentration of about 2-4% fragrance oils. It's very light and often used as a refreshing splash.
Eau Fra√Æche: Contains the lowest concentration of fragrance oils, typically 1-3%. It's very light and often used for a quick refresh.
